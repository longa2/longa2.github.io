## Introduction

With the prevelance of AI increasing in education, and specifically Software Engineering, it has seen many cases in effectively completing assignments for the students without the students having to do much if anything at all. In this course, I have used ChatGPT in rare cases to aid me in generating code for quizzes and assignments.

## Personal Experience with AI:

Here is a list of all the areas I have or have not used AI

### Experience WODs

I have not used AI since they usually have solutions posted for each assignment.

### In-class Practice WODs

I have not used AI mainly due to the fact that we were able to complete and turn in the WOD outside of class time.

### In-class WODs

I have used AI only on the last few of the WODs of the semester, i.e. Nextjs 1 and UI Design (React), among others. The reason why I did not use AI on many of the WODs is due to me not feeling compelled to use AI, however, only when I felt cornered by the time constraint did I feel the need to use AI to generate code for me. There were a few times where I copy-pasted the instructions of the WOD to generate me a solution.

### Essays

I did not use AI because it was writing, not coding under a time limit.

### Final Project

I used AI to help generate code whenever I was stuck on how to code a particular feature.

### Learning a concept / tutorial

I did not use AI because there was no need to in learning new concepts.

### Answering questions in class / in Discord

Although I did not use AI in answering questions in Discord - mainly due to the questions not being too difficult to answer - I have used AI in answering questions in class. This is because of the professor encouraging the use of AI to answer definitional items in certain cases.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Ever since I have incorporated AI into my skill development and learning, I have noticed that I have not fully developed or learned much of the topic at hand. Admittedly, it is not necessary to learn a specific skill to its utmost potential to use it in "practice," however, my usage of AI got to a point where I would use the AI-generated solution in cases where I did not learn a concept to its practical level for me to utilize. As such, it is very simple of me to say that I relied on AI too much for me to consider myself well-learned in software engineering to some degree.

## Practical Applications:
Explore any practical applications of AI outside ICS 314. For instance, discuss if AI has been used in real-world projects, simulations, or collaborative activities (for example the HACC). Evaluate the effectiveness of AI applications in addressing real-world software engineering challenges.

## Challenges and Opportunities:
Identify any challenges or limitations you have encountered in the use of AI within the course. Discuss potential opportunities for further integration of AI in software engineering education.

## Comparative Analysis:
Provide a comparative analysis between traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches in the context of software engineering education. Consider aspects like engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development.

## Future Considerations:
Discuss your thoughts on the future role of AI in software engineering education. Consider potential advancements, challenges, and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion:
Summarize your reflections and insights regarding the use of AI in the Software Engineering course. Conclude with any recommendations or suggestions for optimizing the integration of AI in future courses.
