I. Introduction

With the prevelance of AI increasing in education, and specifically Software Engineering, it has seen many cases in effectively completing assignments for the students without the students having to do much if anything at all. In this course, I have used ChatGPT in rare cases to aid me in generating code for quizzes and assignments.

II. Personal Experience with AI:

Reflect on your personal experiences with AI technologies within ICS 314. Provide specific examples of how you have used AI or explanations as to why you have not used AI (e.g. “I tried it for xxx and found it did not give useful results” or “I thought it important for me to find an answer on my own.”) for each of the following course elements:

Experience WODs e.g. E18
In-class Practice WODs
In-class WODs
Essays
Final project
Learning a concept / tutorial
Answering a question in class or in Discord
Asking or answering a smart-question
Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
Explaining code
Writing code
Documenting code
Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
Copy the list above and address each one. Be sure give specific examples including what prompts you used. For example:

For the Functional programming WOD I asked ChatGPT “Write a function using underscore to implement the following instructions <WOD instructions here>”

For each example, discuss how useful AI was (or was not useful) and the benefits and costs of using it in each example e.g. “I would not know how to start without ChatGPT, but the result was not exactly what was needed and it took a lot of time with trial and error to get a workable result.”.

IMPORTANT Again, if you did not use AI for a course element listed, discuss why you did not, especially if you tried to use AI but found it not helpful or not worth the effort. Do not simply list “I din’t use AI for this element.”

III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Discuss how the incorporation of AI has influenced your learning experience. Consider its impact on comprehension, skill development, and problem-solving abilities. Reflect on whether AI technologies have enhanced or challenged your understanding of software engineering concepts.

IV. Practical Applications:
Explore any practical applications of AI outside ICS 314. For instance, discuss if AI has been used in real-world projects, simulations, or collaborative activities (for example the HACC). Evaluate the effectiveness of AI applications in addressing real-world software engineering challenges.

V. Challenges and Opportunities:
Identify any challenges or limitations you have encountered in the use of AI within the course. Discuss potential opportunities for further integration of AI in software engineering education.

VI. Comparative Analysis:
Provide a comparative analysis between traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches in the context of software engineering education. Consider aspects like engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development.

VII. Future Considerations:
Discuss your thoughts on the future role of AI in software engineering education. Consider potential advancements, challenges, and areas for improvement.

VIII. Conclusion:
Summarize your reflections and insights regarding the use of AI in the Software Engineering course. Conclude with any recommendations or suggestions for optimizing the integration of AI in future courses.
