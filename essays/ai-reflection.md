## Introduction
With the prevelance of AI increasing in education, and specifically Software Engineering, it has seen many cases in effectively completing assignments for the students without the students having to do much if anything at all. In this course, I have used ChatGPT in rare cases to aid me in generating code for quizzes and assignments.

## Personal Experience with AI:
Here is a list of all the areas I have or have not used AI.

#### Experience WODs
I have not used AI since they usually have solutions posted for each assignment.

#### In-class Practice WODs
I have not used AI mainly due to the fact that we were able to complete and turn in the WOD outside of class time.

#### In-class WODs
I have used AI only on the last few of the WODs of the semester, i.e. Nextjs 1 and UI Design (React), among others. The reason why I did not use AI on many of the WODs is due to me not feeling compelled to use AI, however, only when I felt cornered by the time constraint did I feel the need to use AI to generate code for me. There were a few times where I copy-pasted the instructions of the WOD to generate me a solution.

#### Essays
I did not use AI because it was writing, not coding under a time limit.

#### Final Project
I used AI to help generate code whenever I was stuck on how to code a particular feature.

#### Learning a concept / tutorial
I did not use AI because there was no need to in learning new concepts.

#### Answering questions in class / in Discord
Although I did not use AI in answering questions in Discord - mainly due to the questions not being too difficult to answer - I have used AI in answering questions in class. This is because of the professor encouraging the use of AI to answer definitional items in certain cases.

#### Asking or answering a smart-question
Ai was not used in asking or answering a smart-question, mainly because I never asked or answered a smart-question to begin with.

#### Coding example
In the case of using AI to provide coding examples, I have never done so, because if AI can be used to generate legitamite solutions, then why would I generate coding examples even if I am just learning.

#### Explaining code
At times when I have used AI, there were times that when generating code the AI will summarize the code it has generated as a type of auto-response. However, I otherwise did not use AI to help explain code that I did not understand, because I found no case in my time in ICS 314 where I needed AI to help explain any code - let alone feeling compelled to even use it for that purpose.

#### Writing code
I have used AI many times to write code for me, especially in cases where I do not understand how to code in some practical cases. Otherwise, I may also use AI in generating code even in simpler use cases because it is much easier to let AI do the job, particularly when a task is much simpler to do even for a person.

#### Documenting code
As far as documenting code, I did not find myself using AI, because although using AI would make things incredibly simpler, I did not feel compelled to or have found the necessity in using AI to document code in my experience.

#### Quality assurance
I have not used AI in following quality assurance purposes, because for any and all corrections that was needed, I have done so on my own with no AI help.

#### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
In other cases in ICS 314, I did not find myself using AI because I found no such necessity in using it.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding:
Ever since I have incorporated AI into my skill development and learning, I have noticed that I have not fully developed or learned much of the topic at hand. Admittedly, it is not necessary to learn a specific skill to its utmost potential to use it in "practice," however, my usage of AI got to a point where I would use the AI-generated solution in cases where I did not learn a concept to its practical level for me to utilize. As such, it is very simple of me to say that I relied on AI too much for me to consider myself well-learned in software engineering to some degree.

## Practical Applications:
Explore any practical applications of AI outside ICS 314. For instance, discuss if AI has been used in real-world projects, simulations, or collaborative activities (for example the HACC). Evaluate the effectiveness of AI applications in addressing real-world software engineering challenges.

## Challenges and Opportunities:
Identify any challenges or limitations you have encountered in the use of AI within the course. Discuss potential opportunities for further integration of AI in software engineering education.

## Comparative Analysis:
As far as using AI in education comparative to traditional teaching methods, there just as many benefits as there are drawbacks. AI is being used as a way in generating solutions and information among other use cases. If it is necessary in garnering information quickly, it can be done with AI within seconds of it "thinking." It could even help with explaing further in detail why the solution is the solution. However, in some cases, it could degrade the educational experience due to it providing an immediate solution to the problems that it is given. Therefore, the student may not retain a practical skill for them to use later on in their career or education. This is where traditional teaching methods are much more effective. Although it may seem tedious to do so, practice makes perfect. Thus, in terms of effective learning and training, doing the raw practice allows for the student to retain the information much more easily.

## Future Considerations:
The future prospect of AI in software engineering education is still in its early stages. The more people use AI, the more AI is trained and developed further to reach its potential. Thus, at some point, there may come a time when almost everyone is reliant on AI to do even the simplest of things. In software engineering education, AI is already being used to generate code such that students could simply "vibe-code" their way through the course. But, although it seems that AI is the easy way out, there are some cases where using AI is detrimental in a student's education. If in fact the student vibe-codes their way through, their effective learning of the course material becomes essentially void due to the reliancy of AI. As such, at the moment it seems that AI is effectively being used more as a Wikipedia search that can also adapt and provide examples/solutions to problems.

## Conclusion:
Summarize your reflections and insights regarding the use of AI in the Software Engineering course. Conclude with any recommendations or suggestions for optimizing the integration of AI in future courses.
AI can be used effectively - if only responsibly. Simply put, there are times where being too reliant on AI is detrimental to the education, while using AI in certain cases can be incredibly profound and useful for said education. As for using AI responsibly, if there is some type of restriction in place to disallow AI from being used too excessively, it may help in furthering the benefits of using AI for software engineering education.
