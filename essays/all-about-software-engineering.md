## What is Software Engineering
Software Engineering includes a multitude of various tools, methodologies, and ideas meshed together coherently such that it culminates into a project designed and intended for some practical use.

## Open Source Software Development
Among the many tools at a software engineer's disposal are open source software. Open source software refers to software that has been developed by many people far and wide. It is the opposite of proprietary software in which that is developed by a dedicated team. One such notable software is GitHub, a place where projects are stored in "repositories" and are often actively being developed on by various people. GitHub is well-known - and thus often used - for how well it maintains such projects. Of course there is other software similar to GitHub, but GitHub happens to be the most used amongst them all. Moreover, it is often found that open source software tends to be much more effective in performing tasks in comparison to proprietary software.

## Coding Standards
In the process of developing software, a project could easily go awry when developers make various changes and additions to it.
