## What is Software Engineering
Software Engineering includes a multitude of various tools, methodologies, and ideas meshed together coherently such that it culminates into a project designed and intended for some practical use. Some particular tools and methodologies are used so often that many software engineers make it synonymous to the process of software engineering. 

## Open Source Software Development
Among the many tools at a software engineer's disposal are open source software. Open source software refers to software that has been developed by many people far and wide. It is the opposite of proprietary software in which that is developed by a dedicated team. One such notable software is GitHub, a place where projects are stored in "repositories" and are often actively being developed on by various people. GitHub is well-known, and thus often used, for how well it maintains such projects. Of course there is other software similar to GitHub, but GitHub happens to be the most used amongst them all.

Compared to the development of open source software, there is also proprietary software that is maintained by a dedicated team. From this difference, it is often found that open source software tends to be much more effective in performing tasks in comparison to proprietary software.

## Coding Standards
In the process of developing software, a project could easily go awry when developers make various changes and additions to it. As such, coding standards are applied such that the project does not result in a coding mess that other developers would not understand at a glance and have to waste time to do as such. Coding standards are what allows for developers, especially a team of software engineers, to be able to code efficiently and effectively. It allows for the code to be read and understood quickly, and by following these standards, it also allows for the project development process to run much more smoothly than it otherwise would have.

## Conclusion
Software Engineering has generated many projects, some of which have become a staple piece of software that various people continue to use to this very day. Other times, it has also produced questionable, or even mildly frustrating, pieces of software - some of which many people continue to use despite the downsides.
