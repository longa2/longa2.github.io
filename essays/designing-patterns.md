## Patterns

The concept of designing anything relies on the consistency, or pattern, of select ideas or functionality. For example, when designing an application, it should be taken into consideration how the application shall be used. So, when using the application, every user that interacts with it will be able to use it effortlessly, efficiently, and so on. Otherwise, it may seem as though there is no semblance of consistent design that users can latch onto, thus, making it more difficult to use for the average user.
