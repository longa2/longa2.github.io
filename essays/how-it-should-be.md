*Etiquette: The customary behavior of members of a profession, business, law, or sports team towards each other.*

## Standards

I love standards. If not for standards, nothing good would come into place--simple as that. Otherwise, chaos would ensue, and anything intellectually designed would fall apart. Similarly, if a company were to hire subpar employees, the company would not hold together, products and services would fall incredibly short of expectations, and the company itself would have a lot of issues internally. So, when doing anything in life, one must hold themselves to a "high standard" such that when doing any form of activity, the output of that activity is of most rewarding. In other words, even the smallest of discrepancies can lead to a less rewarding outcome.

## Coding

In terms of coding standards, one may assume that you may code and format however you like so long as the code functions as intended. Sure enough, if it's not broken, don't fix it. However, if it does happen to be broken for some causal reason, it will be much more tedious in determining the problem. Depending on how the standards are, one could also assume that deviating very slightly from the standards would not be too troublesome if other people do not notice the difference or have trouble with reading/fixing one's code. Although other people may not, it may lead to a subpar production of a service or product. Particularly in a team environment, if one team member's code fails to meet expectations, the rest of the code developed by the other team members will also share the same fate. As such, although the product may work as intended, without standards, one would not be able to expand on the existing code as seamlessly as one could with standards.
