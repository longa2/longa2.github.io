## Overture

Computers have always been a perplexing object for quite a number of people. However, I am not such a person. Contrary to others, computers have caught my attention since my younger years. As my life went on, further in maturity, I have realized my affinity for technology, and in particular, the components that make computers the way that they are.

Throughout my life, I have always been curiously searching for the many answers to life. One fateful day, I found myself infatuated with technology - such is the day I question: why such a thing is gifted from the course of life. As I wander throughout my life, I encounter more and more of the capabilities, and further do I think of the possibilities that I am able to use it for.

## Chord

As I begin to explore the depths that which make a computer, the realization dawns on me that there is much simplicity to its magnificent creation. The instructions are clearly purposed and the functioning hardware is well-designed - such interconnectivity lays the groundwork of greater invention: software.

Software brings with it the aptitude for further creation and development of its kind, thus, it has also captured the prospect of many minds - one such is me. For all that I have witnessed, software has been one of the most fundamental assets in my life. Many creations have spawned from such a medium: the plethora of video games; unique automation tools; and even simple daily life applications that many utilize today. As with any other creative entertainment, there are many that seek to use and exploit its bountiful resources. Thus, security becomes most prevalent - this is where I truly seek among my many interests. Of the many inventions humanity has created, software is the groundwork that many people function on nowadays - and security is what allows many to continue in their life with ease and peace.

## Cadence

As I am right now, I am nowhere near enough in truly understanding the vast nature of software development and how intricate security can play in its existence. In general, I do not believe to understand the full scope of security across the long lines of code that many have written. However, as ever-growing as security is, I hope to be able to achieve at least the baseline - and perhaps figure out my specialization in the cybersecurity field - before I graduate.
