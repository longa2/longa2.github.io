Everybody loves a good image. Whether it be physical looks, or a drawing of some character, people love the logical design of many creations. That of course includes websites and their webpages. A website that has good, appealing designs for its pages will find many users often clicking around just for how well made - or interactive - it is. That being said, it can be quite the effort in not only sketching out a webpage, but also implementing the sketch into reality. 

## Graphical Tools

When building a webpage, there are many tools one can use to develop. In this day and age, most, if not all, websites are built upon HTML. Within the framework of HTML, there are a number of additional tools that can be imported, namely, Bootstrap 5.
