*Design: A graphic representation, especially a detailed plan for construction or manufacture.*

## The What

Everybody loves a good image. Whether it be physical looks, or a drawing of some character, people love the logical design of many creations. That of course includes websites and their webpages. A website that has good, appealing designs for its pages will find many users often clicking around just for how well made - or interactive - it is. That being said, it can be quite the effort in not only sketching out a webpage, but also implementing the sketch into reality. 

## The How

When building a webpage, there are many tools one can use to develop. In this day and age, most, if not all, websites are built upon HTML. Within the framework of HTML, there are a number of additional tools that can be imported, namely, Bootstrap 5. Bootstrap 5 was made for the purposes of an easier process in designing and implementing a webpage. Not only that, it also includes new interactive designs that can be a direct replacement from HTML's designs. That being said, it still can take quite the effort when designing. 

## The Why

Even when Bootstrap was designed to make designing a webpage easier, there are many things that can still go awry. At times, a background image may not show properly, or a block of text may not be in the correct postition as intended. Then, why use a tool that is intended to make the process easier only for problems to still come along? Simply put, the payoff is that much more rewarding and important. Nowadays, websites are becoming more and more complex, detailed, and interactive. As such, it makes for a more interactive and enjoyable experience when users browse the internet. And because it drives more traffic as a result, it then becomes more competitive to have users go to your website and peruse through anything that may be on there instead of other websites.
