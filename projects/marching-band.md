Throughout my entire high school career, I was a part of my high school's marching band. Within my time, I have partook in many parade marches, musical performances, and marching shows. Consistently, we as a band come together weekly to practice our performance shows, marching, and music.

One of my favorite performances that we did was based on the '1001 Arabian Nights' called 'SCHEHERAZADE.'
Here is a video of one of our performances on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viIGAdwvqhQ&list=RDviIGAdwvqhQ&start_radio=1).
