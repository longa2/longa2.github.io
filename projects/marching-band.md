Throughout my entire high school career, I was a part of my high school's marching band. Within my time, I have partook in many parade marches, musical performances, and marching shows.

In the marching band, I was one of the performers that played the trumpet instrument. Consistently, we as a band come together weekly to practice our performance shows, marching, and music.

What I have learned through this experience is that nothing comes from doing nothing. In other words, great work comes about from great effort whether if it were in the arts, sciences, and such. As such, I have committed myself more to the art of performance as part of this marching band. 

One of my favorite performances that we did was based on the '1001 Arabian Nights' called 'SCHEHERAZADE.'
Here is a video of one of our performances on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viIGAdwvqhQ&list=RDviIGAdwvqhQ&start_radio=1).
