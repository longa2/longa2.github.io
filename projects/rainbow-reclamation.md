Rainbow Reclamation is a website project created for my ICS 314 class. Me, along with three other developers, have teamed up together to improve UH Manoa's current Lost & Found website so that it may encourage people to go out and find people's lost items. This project utilizes a database that allows the storage of information of any person's lost item.

My main contributions to this project includes various front-end and back-end features. I have contributed a 'Recovery Instructions' page that is specifically designed to inform the user if any of their items have been located. I have also designed the 'Lost Item Submissions' page where it allows users to submit their lost items in hopes that it may be found. With the 'Lost Item Submissions' page, I have added the functionality such that this page allows users to add their lost items to the database to be stored and updated as appropriate.
