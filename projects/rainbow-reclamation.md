Rainbow Reclamation is a website project created for my ICS 314 class. Me, along with three other developers, have teamed up together to improve UH Manoa's current Lost & Found website so that it may encourage people to go out and find people's lost items. This project utilizes a database that allows the storage of information of any person's lost item.

My main contributions to this project includes various front-end and back-end features. I have contributed a 'Recovery Instructions' page that is specifically designed to inform the user if any of their items have been located. I have also designed the 'Lost Item Submissions' page where it allows users to submit their lost items in hopes that it may be found. With the 'Lost Item Submissions' page, I have added the functionality such that this page allows users to add their lost items to the database to be stored and updated as appropriate. Similarly, I have linked the database such that it will show user-specific items in the 'User Dashboard' page, as well as showing any found items in the 'Browse Items' page.

Throughout the development of this project, I have experienced and learned the process of software engineering. By working in a team environment, I have learned what to expect of my team members' from their abilities as a coder and the amount of time that is allowed from their schedules. As such, from a management position, I have come to expect that as a team we may not be able to resolve any outlined issues by each project deadline. What I have also learned was finding good times in scheduling meetings with the entire team. Especially given each team members' tight schedule, it did give much difficulty in finding a good time for a meeting. However, in some way or another, our whole team has managed to stay in contact with each other frequently enough so that our project may come to fruition.
