This is a software project created for my ICS 314 class. It is a website designed specifically to help those who have lost any of their items on campus.

My main contributions to this project includes various front-end and back-end features. I have contributed a 'Recovery Instructions' page that is specifically designed to inform the user if any of their items have been located. I have also designed the 'Lost Item Submissions' page where it allows users to submit any items
